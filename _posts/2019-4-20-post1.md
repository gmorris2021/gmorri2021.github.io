Hello world!

We are Griffin and Alexa and this is going to be our blog for the ESE 350 Final Project. For anyone who is reading this, we wanted to provide an opening post just describing what our project, The Auto-Adjust Pillow, is, what it does, and why we're making it. We hope you enjoy our blog!

The Auto-Adjust Pillow
----------------------

Our project, the auto-adjust pillow, is a pillow that addresses the problem of stiff neck, a problem that many people face every night they sleep. Stiff neck occurs because when people sleep, they generally stay in the same position in the middle of the night without moving, and often since these positions are unnatural for the body, they can wake up with a stiff neck. As such, alongside Dr. Gooneratne Nalaka, we wanted to create an embedded device that could address these problems.
