title: Week 1!

Hey everyone,

Welcome back to the blog. This week we got the first of our parts and started figuring out how to work them.

Our list of parts for these week are:
1. A pressure sensitive sheet that will be used for measuring the head pressure in our pillow.
2. Solenoid valves that will be used for turning on and off the airflow into the pillow, in order to allow air to only come through when we want it.
3. An air blower for actually inflating the pillow.

For this week, we spent a lot of our time just trying to figure out the pressure sheets. We first assumed that their pressure would be relatively small, so we put them in series with a 1000 ohm resistor, only to notice absolutely no change in voltage drop across the sheets whether we pushed on the pressure sheets or not. We finally decided to hook them up to the DMM and just measure resistance, which finally allowed us to realize that the resistance was in the 100k ohms range. The sheet itself and the resistance value when it was flat vs bent (effectively putting pressure on it) can be seen below.
