Hey everyone,

Welcome back to the blog. This week we got the first of our parts and started figuring out how to work them.

Our list of parts for these week are:
1. A pressure sensitive sheet that will be used for measuring the head pressure in our pillow.
2. Solenoid valves that will be used for turning on and off the airflow into the pillow, in order to allow air to only come through when we want it.
3. An air blower for actually inflating the pillow.
Pressure sheet:
