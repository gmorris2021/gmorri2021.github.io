title: Week 4 and Reach Demo!
---

Welcome back again everyone! It has been a long week with almost no sleep, but we finished!

This week, in moving from our baseline to reach demos, we had three main things that we worked on. Revamping our pressure sensors, moving to multichamber inflation, and cleaning up our product. In terms of new parts needed this week, we needed:

1. Copper foil for our pressure sensors
2. Smaller pillows for our multichamber pillow
3. 3D printed parts to split the tubing from the blower
4. A new air compressor that was larger and more powerful.

For the first goal, we realized that needed to use the sheets flat instead of folded, and that we needed to find a way to attach wires (not banana clips) in order to cover more surface area and make the pillow actually useable. We realized, that using copper foil alongside the pressure sheets, we could accomplish both. We first made a small prototype before we created the larger one for our pillow. What we did was we layered two sheets with three rows each of copper foil, put these rows perpendicular, and then put a pressure sheet inbetween them. Next, we soldered wire to the ends of the copper foil and hooked up 3 ends to power, 3 to the analog out, and 3 to ground. The power end and ground end were opposite one another, with the analog end perpendicular to them. This can be seen below:
